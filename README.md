## Convert Markdown Resume/cv to a PDF

Value proposition:
1. Easy version control for CV
2. You can, for example, link to the generated PDF from your homepage and thus always share an up-to-date version of it

Requirements on Github:
- You need to allow for Workflow permissions -> Read and write permissions
- This will make it possible for the Action to commit to the repository

Steps to use this minimal automation:
1. Fork the repo/copy the contents
2. Modify the resume.md in any way that suites your needs
3. Add you commit
4. Push to your forked repo
5. A wild resume.pdf has appeared
